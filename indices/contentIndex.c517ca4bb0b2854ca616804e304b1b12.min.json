The team, composed of 10 individuals, had been underperforming for six months before the current manager took over. The main challenges identified were a lack of predictability in the process and the presence of a toxic team member. The manager employed a data-driven approach and implemented several changes to the team's process and addressed the toxic team member. The changes resulted in a significant improvement in team performance, as demonstrated by increases in throughput and planning accuracy. The study suggests that a data-driven approach, combined with effective strategies for addressing interpersonal issues, can lead to improvements in team performance.\n\n## Background\n\nThe team in question had 10 members and was composed of a mix of frontend and backend engineers, and QA, distributed across many time zones from Brazil, across Europe, and all the way to Thailand. The team's purpose was to enable a new value stream for the company. The team had been underperforming for six months before the current manager took over. The main challenges identified were a lack of predictability in the process and the presence of a toxic team member.\n\n## Methods\n\nTo address the challenges faced by the team, the manager employed a data-driven approach and implemented several changes to the team's process. The manager first analyzed the situation and found that despite the carry-over, the team's velocity was extremely stable, and predictability was not an issue. To alleviate the anxiety around carry-over, the manager decided to move from Scrum to Kanban, which does not have the concept of sprints and therefore no carry-over. Additionally, the manager dropped task estimation in favor of consistent break-down of tasks. To address the toxic team member, the manager tried to work closely with the individual, highlighting the value of team collaboration and sensitizing them to the effect their behavior had on the team. When this didn't work, the manager moved on to team exercises, hoping that increased levels of trust would make a difference. When none of these things worked, the manager removed the person from the team.\n\n## Results\n\nThe changes implemented by the manager resulted in a significant improvement in team performance. The team moved from velocity in story points to throughput in the number of tasks for the whole team. With every change, the team was able to see notable increases in this throughput. Additionally, the team started tracking their planning accuracy, and as they grew more comfortable with the new mode of working, the accuracy increased month over month. The removal of the toxic team member also had a positive impact on the overall team output, despite the decrease in head-count.\n\n## Discussion\n\nEffective team performance is essential for the success of any organization. However, teams can face a variety of challenges that can negatively impact their performance. This case study examines the challenges faced by a low-performing team in the freelancing industry and the strategies employed to improve team performance.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe case study demonstrates that a data-driven approach to addressing team issues, combined with effective strategies for addressing interpersonal issues, can lead to significant improvements in team performance. The key factors in the team's turnaround were the changes to the process to combat the team's anxiety and the removal of the toxic colleague to combat the undermining behavior. The study also highlights the importance of providing a long-term solution by training a successor and passing on the knowledge and techniques used to turn the team around.\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Cost-Benefit Analysis\n\nBenefits:\n\n1.

The ERP Interface Team, consisting of six engineers, was tasked with building a new ERP interface for the company's product. The initial delivery time forecast was four months, which the team sought to improve. The goal of this case study is to outline the methods used by the Engineering Manager to increase the delivery speed of the ERP Interface Team by 60%.\n\n## Background\nIn today's fast-paced business environment, companies are constantly looking for ways to improve their delivery times. In the case of the ERP Interface Team, the challenge was to deliver the new interface as soon as possible. To achieve this goal, the Engineering Manager used a new tool to visualize insights into the delivery process, enabling the team to identify areas of improvement.\n\n## Methods\nThe Engineering Manager introduced a new tool to help the team identify bottlenecks in the delivery process. By analyzing cycle time, inventory sizes, and wait times for code review and deployment, the team was able to shorten review and deploy times, nearly double throughput, and reduce work item inventories. These improvements resulted in a delivery time of 2.5 months, a 60% improvement over the initial forecast.\n\n## Results\nThe team's success inspired another team to follow their example, resulting in a 45% improvement in their own delivery speed. The Engineering Manager gave a presentation to the company, detailing the team's efforts, results, and the tool used to achieve these results. This led to negotiations with the vendor to roll out the tool across the entire company.\n\n## Discussion\nThe results of this case study demonstrate the impact that process improvements can have on delivery speed. By using a new tool to visualize insights into the delivery process and by making improvements to cycle time, inventory sizes, and wait times, the ERP Interface Team was able to significantly increase their delivery speed. This case study also highlights the importance of collaboration and support from other teams in achieving organizational goals.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the methods used by the Engineering Manager and the ERP Interface Team led to a 60% improvement in delivery speed. The success of this initiative inspired other teams within the organization to adopt similar methods, leading to additional improvements in delivery speed. These results demonstrate the importance of continuous improvement and the impact that process improvements can have on delivery speed.\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Cost-Benefit Analysis\nThe implementation of the new tool and processes for tracking and improving delivery speed came with a cost, but also brought significant benefits. The cost of the tool was \\$5/person on the team/month, for a team of 6 engineers, this amounted to \\$30/month or \\$360 per year.\n\nHowever, by reducing the delivery time by 1.5 months, the company was able to save on the salary costs of the engineering team. With an average base salary of \\$70,000 per team member, the total salary cost savings would amount to \\$52,500 (6 x 70,000 / 12 x 1.5).\n\nThe net benefit of implementing the tool and processes is therefore \\$52,140 (\\$52,500 - \\$360). This is a significant financial gain for the company and demonstrates the value of analyzing and improving processes, as well as the importance of tooling to support these efforts.\n\nIn addition to the financial benefits, the increase in delivery speed also improved the company's ability to respond to market demands and meet customer needs more efficiently, potentially leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. These benefits are more difficult to quantify, but should not be ignored.\n\nOverall, the cost-benefit analysis shows that investing in tooling and process improvement can lead to substantial financial gains, as well as other benefits that can contribute to the success of the company.\n\n## See also\n\n[[notes/Goodhart's Law]]\n[[notes/Little's Law]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-09T10:35:15.906896095Z","tags":null},"/notes/Team-Retention":{"title":"Team Retention","content":"## Introduction\n\nAcquisitions are a common occurrence in the business world and can lead to significant changes for employees, including uncertainty, and stress. These changes can lead to high turnover rates, which can negatively impact the company's performance. This study aims to examine a specific instance of an acquihire, where a company was acquired, and a specific team within that company was targeted to be retained. The challenge was to retain the team despite the trying times they went through, which typically cause some percentage of churn.\n\n## Background\n\nThe problem at hand was to retain a team through an acquihire. The team had great expectations in terms of money and career advancement that didn't come true. Promises were made and not kept, expectations were high, but returns were low. This put the team in a bad place and could lead to a high percentage of churn and a loss of valuable team members.\n\n## Methods\n\nTo address the problem, the management team engaged with the team on a personal basis. They found out what motivated them and tried to find opportunities for them to act out these motivations. They also acknowledged the team's losses in terms of opportunity and their sense of being let down. They emphasized how they were all in the same boat and encouraged the team to focus on new opportunities as they presented themselves. To connect with the team on a personal basis, the management team used specific methods such as one-on-ones, techniques from the books \"Finding your Why\" and \"Radical Candor\", team and individual lunches, and non-work-related fun activities.\n\nOne team member was specifically struggling with the lack of career advancement opportunities. The management team engaged with this team member through one-on-one meetings and shared lunches to better understand their career aspirations and personal vision. Through this engagement, they discovered that this team member's dream job was in a completely different field. The management team then developed a plan to help this team member skill up within the current organization as much as possible, in order to prepare them for a future transition to their desired field.\n\nAnother team member was struggling to find their true north and regain confidence in their choices. To address this, the management team used the \"personal why\" exercise from \"Finding Your Why\" to help this team member find their true north and find new meaning in their job. This exercise falls under the Law of the Instrument, where in this case, the management team is using a specific exercise to help the team member to find the core of their motivation.\n\n## Results\n\nAs a result of these actions, the management team was able to retain 100% of the team despite the trying times they went through, which typically cause some percentage of churn. This is a clear indication of the success of the actions taken by the management team. Additionally, the team was more engaged and performed better, which could be an effect of the Hawthorne Effect and the Pygmalion Effect, where the team members were motivated by the attention they were receiving and the positive expectations placed upon them, respectively.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis study demonstrates the importance of effective retention strategies, especially during times of change such as an acquihire. By building close relationships with team members and understanding their motivations, the management team was able to retain 100% of the team. This aligns with the principle of the Self-Fulfilling Prophecy, where the management team's emphasis on new opportunities and encouragement of the team to focus on these opportunities led the team members to believe that they had a brighter future within the company, which in turn motivated them to work harder and stay with the company.\n\nAdditionally, by acknowledging the losses and emphasizing a sense of unity, the management team was able to create a positive and supportive environment that promoted team cohesion and engagement. This aligns with the principle of the Ringelmann Effect, which states that the performance of a group is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nFinally, the management team's use of specific tools such as the \"personal why\" exercise helped to address specific issues that individual team members were facing and helped them find new meaning and motivation in their job, aligning with the Law of the Instrument.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this study highlights the effectiveness of using retention strategies that focus on building relationships, understanding personal motivations, and creating a sense of unity. These strategies can be applied in similar situations to improve retention and performance. Additionally, the specific methods used in this case study such as the \"personal why\" exercise, can be used to address specific issues that individual team members may be facing, aligning with the Law of the Instrument.\n\n## Appendix\n### Cost-Benefit Analysis\n\nBenefits:\n\n1.  100% retention of the team, avoiding high turnover rates and negative impact on company performance. This could have cost the company a significant amount of money, as replacing an employee can cost as much as 1.5 to 2 times the employee's annual salary. For a team of 10 people, this could have cost the company between \\$120,000 to \\$160,000.\n2.  Improved team engagement and performance, leading to increased productivity and profits. The improved performance could lead to an estimated increase in profits of \\$100,000 to \\$200,000 per year.\n3.  Addressed specific issues faced by individual team members, leading to increased job satisfaction and motivation. This could lead to improved retention rates in the long term, reducing turnover costs and increasing profits.\n4.  Created a positive and supportive environment, promoting team cohesion and a sense of unity. This could lead to improved morale and job satisfaction, reducing turnover rates and increasing profits.\n\nCosts:\n\n1.  Time and resources invested in building relationships with team members, including one-on-ones, lunches, and non-work-related activities. The cost of these activities could be estimated at \\$20,000 to \\$30,000.\n2.  Time and resources invested in training and skill development for team members. The cost of training could be estimated at \\$10,000 to \\$20,000.\n3.  Potential loss of productivity during the transition and implementation of the retention strategies. The cost of lost productivity could be estimated at \\$20,000 to \\$30,000.\n\nOverall, the benefits of the retention strategies outweighed the costs, resulting in a successful outcome for the acquihire and a net positive return on investment. The estimated net benefit could be between \\$140,000 to \\$300,000 per year.","lastmodified":"2023-02-09T10:35:15.906896095Z","tags":null},"/notes/Team-Retention-2":{"title":"Team Retention 2","content":"\n## Introduction\n\nThis study aims to examine the factors that contributed to the retention of one team at a company that operates in the circular economy space, focusing on workplace assets. The study was conducted following a series of lay-offs that had a significant impact on team retention at this company. The study found that clear and transparent communication, along with a focus on employee well-being and engagement, played a key role in the retention of the team in question. Additionally, the team that was retained works in a unique domain of circular economy and workplace assets, which provided a sense of purpose and motivation for team members to stay with the company. The team leader applied techniques from the book \"5 Dysfunctions of a Team\" by Patrick Lencioni, which helped to build a cohesive team through trust, conflict, commitment, accountability, and results. A cost-benefit analysis was conducted, showing a high return on investment in terms of employee retention.\n\n## Background\n\nThe company operates in the circular economy space, focusing on workplace assets and experienced a significant impact on team retention as a result of recent lay-offs, but one team was able to maintain stability while others lost members. The team leader of the retained team applied techniques from the book \"5 Dysfunctions of a Team\" by Patrick Lencioni, which helped to build a cohesive team through trust, conflict, commitment, accountability, and results. A specific technique used was the \"personal histories exercise\" which helped to increase trust among team members. The team leader also fostered discussions through leading by example, thereby increasing the potential to handle conflict among the team in a healthy way. The retention rate of the team in question was 100%, while the other two teams lost 1 out of 5 and 2 out of 7 members respectively.\n\n## Methods\n\nThe study was conducted by interviewing the team leader of the retained team and analyzing the company's internal communication and employee retention strategies. A cost-benefit analysis was also conducted to measure the return on investment of the techniques implemented in terms of employee retention.\n\n## Results\n\nThe study found that clear and transparent communication, along with a focus on employee well-being and engagement, played a key role in the retention of the team in question. Additionally, the team that was retained works in a unique domain of circular economy and workplace assets, which provided a sense of purpose and motivation for team members to stay with the company.

The use of techniques from \"5 Dysfunctions of a Team\" as well as the specific focus on a unique and purposeful domain can be a powerful tool for employee retention. The cost-benefit analysis showed that the return on investment of these techniques in terms of employee retention is high.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the case study demonstrates that by creating a supportive and cohesive team environment, fostering trust, commitment, accountability, and results, and providing a sense of purpose and motivation, a company can retain its team members even in challenging times. The use of techniques from \"5 dysfunctions of a team\" as well as the specific focus on a unique and purposeful domain can be a powerful tool for employee retention. The cost-benefit analysis showed that the return on investment of these techniques in terms of employee retention is high.\n\nIt is worth noting that while the cost-benefit analysis provides valuable information on the financial return of implementing these techniques, it is important to also consider the non-financial benefits of employee retention. These can include improved morale, increased productivity, and reduced recruitment and training costs.\n\nAdditionally, it is important for the company to continue monitoring and evaluating the retention rate of the team and to make adjustments as needed. It is also suggested that the company should conduct similar retention studies on other teams in order to identify any common patterns and areas for improvement.\n\nThis case study highlights the importance of effective communication, employee well-being, and engagement in retaining team members, and also how working in a unique and purposeful domain can be a motivation for employees to stay in the company. Despite the challenges of layoffs, the company was able to retain one team completely by focusing on these key areas and by providing a sense of purpose to the team, and also by applying techniques from \"5 dysfunctions of a team\". The cost-benefit analysis shows a high return on investment in terms of employee retention. The company should continue monitoring and evaluating the retention rate of the teams and implement similar studies on other teams in order to identify patterns and areas for improvement.\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Book\n\n\"5 Dysfunctions of a Team\" by Patrick Lencioni is a book that emphasizes the importance of building a cohesive team through trust, conflict, commitment, accountability, and results. It provides a framework for understanding the underlying issues that can prevent teams from performing at their best and offers practical strategies for overcoming these challenges. The book is based on the idea that trust, the foundation of any healthy team, is built on the five dysfunctions: absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, and inattention to results. By addressing and overcoming these dysfunctions, teams can improve their performance and achieve their goals.\n\n### Cost-benefit analysis\n\nGiven, the cost of implementing the techniques from \"5 Dysfunctions of a Team\" is \\$10,000. The benefit of retaining the team of 10 employees would be \\$500,000 (estimated average salary of each employee per year times 10). The benefit of retaining the other two teams would be: \\$175,000 and \\$112,500 respectively.\n\nSo, the cost-benefit ratio for the team of 10 would be (500,000-10,000)/10,000 = 49 The cost-benefit ratio for the other two teams would be (175,000-10,000)/10,000 = 16 and (112,500-10,000)/10,000 = 10.5 respectively.\n\nThis cost-benefit analysis shows that the techniques from \"5 dysfunctions of a team\" have a high return on investment in terms of employee retention. The cost of implementing these techniques is outweighed by the benefits of retaining employees, resulting in a high cost-benefit ratio.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-09T10:35:15.906896095Z","tags":null}}
