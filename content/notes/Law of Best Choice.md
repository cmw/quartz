# Law of Best Choice
> An applicant must be selected on some time interval from an unknown number of rankable applicants. The goal is to maximize the probability of selecting only the best under the hypothesis that all arrival orders of different ranks are equally likely.

# Strategy
1. Set a time interval (deadline) in which to find a candidate
2. Examine and [[interview]] applicants coming in
3. For the first 37% of the time interval, reject all candidates, even if they succeed throughout the process
4. Keep a log of all applicants strengths and qualities
5. After the first 37% of the time interval have passed, interview all future applicants as in step 2
6. [[Hire]] the first [[applicant]] that scores better than _all_ previous.

# Added benefit
- Maximizing value return from placement agencies
- Mitigate [[sunk cost fallacy]] and [[confirmation bias]] to some extent
